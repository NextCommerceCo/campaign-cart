Get Campaign Cart up and running on your site in just 2 minutes.

## Installation in 3 Steps

<Steps>

1. **Get your API key**

   Sign up at [Campaign Cart Dashboard](https://dashboard.campaigncart.com) and copy your API key from settings.

2. **Add to your HTML**

   Add this to your `<head>` tag:

   ```html
   <meta name="next-api-key" content="YOUR_API_KEY">
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/NextCommerceCo/campaign-cart/dist/loader.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Add your first button**

   ```html
   <button data-next-action="add-to-cart" data-next-package-id="1">
     Add to Cart
   </button>
   ```

</Steps>

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Your button will now add products to the cart when clicked.

## Test Your Setup

Open your browser's console and look for:
```
âœ… Campaign Cart SDK initialized
```

Click your button - you should see the cart update. The SDK automatically:
- Manages cart state
- Persists data across page refreshes
- Syncs with your Campaign Cart dashboard
- Handles checkout when ready
