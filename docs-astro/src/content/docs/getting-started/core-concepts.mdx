Campaign Cart is a powerful JavaScript SDK that transforms any website into a conversion-optimized e-commerce funnel using simple HTML attributes. No complex integrations, no steep learning curvesâ€”just add data attributes to your HTML and watch your site come alive with cart functionality.

## What is Campaign Cart?

Campaign Cart JS SDK is an **attribute-driven e-commerce solution** that enables developers to build sophisticated shopping experiences using familiar HTML patterns. Instead of learning complex APIs or frameworks, you simply add `data-next-*` attributes to your HTML elements.
