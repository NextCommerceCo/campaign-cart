# Introduction to Campaign Cart JS SDK

Campaign Cart is a powerful JavaScript SDK that transforms any website into a conversion-optimized e-commerce funnel using simple HTML attributes. No complex integrations, no steep learning curvesâ€”just add data attributes to your HTML and watch your site come alive with cart functionality.

## What is Campaign Cart?

Campaign Cart JS SDK is an **attribute-driven e-commerce solution** that enables developers to build sophisticated shopping experiences using familiar HTML patterns. Instead of learning complex APIs or frameworks, you simply add `data-next-*` attributes to your HTML elements.

**Think of it as Bootstrap for e-commerce** - just add classes (attributes) to get powerful functionality.

## How It Works

### 1. **Attribute-Driven Architecture**
Instead of writing JavaScript, you describe what you want using HTML attributes:

```html
<!-- Traditional approach -->
<script>
  function addToCart() {
    // 20+ lines of code...
  }
</script>

<!-- Campaign Cart approach -->
<button data-next-action="add-to-cart" 
        data-next-package-id="product-123">
  Add to Cart
</button>
```

### 2. **Automatic State Management**
The SDK handles all the complex state management for you:
- Cart persistence across page reloads
- Real-time price calculations
- Inventory tracking
- User session management

### 3. **Built-in Conversion Tools**
Get advanced e-commerce features out of the box:
- Post-purchase upsells
- Exit-intent popups
- FOMO notifications
- A/B testing capabilities
