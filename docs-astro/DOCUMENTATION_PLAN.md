# Campaign Cart SDK Documentation Masterplan

## Writing Style Guide

### Persona
You are a pragmatic developer who values transparency and composability. 
You're confident in your approach but respect the reader's intelligence.

### Structure
1. **Bold opening:** What this is (1 sentence)
2. **The problem:** What existing solutions get wrong (2-3 sentences)
3. **Core principles:** 3-5 principles as bullet points with bold labels
4. **Detailed explanation:** One section per principle with practical implications
5. **Concrete examples:** Show don't tell

### Style Rules
- Use second person ("you")
- Lead with problems, follow with solutions
- Use "This means:" to translate concepts into benefits
- Include comparative framing ("In typical [X]... With [our approach]...")
- Keep paragraphs under 4 sentences
- Bold key concepts on first use
- No hedging language ("simply," "just," "easily" are fine; "we believe," "might" are not)
- Technical precision, conversational delivery

### Tone
Confident, helpful, opinionated but not preachy. Like a senior developer 
explaining their architecture decisions to a competent teammate.

## Documentation Philosophy

**Campaign Cart is an HTML-first e-commerce SDK that treats your markup as a contract, not a suggestion.**

### The Problem

Most e-commerce SDKs force you into their component system, breaking your carefully crafted designs and requiring complete rewrites. They inject their own DOM, override your styles, and make you fight for control of your own website. You end up spending more time working around the SDK than building your store.

### Core Principles

- **HTML as the API:** Your markup defines behavior through data attributes
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Works without JavaScript, transforms with it
- **Zero Lock-in:** Remove our script tag and your site still functions
- **Composable Architecture:** Use individual features without adopting everything
- **Transparent Operations:** Every action is inspectable, every state is accessible

---

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working (8/38 files complete)
- Strong foundation pages (index, introduction, quick-start)
- Comprehensive installation guide
- Excellent first-product-page tutorial
- Interactive playground with live demos
- Solid API methods reference
- Detailed configuration reference

### Critical Gaps (26/38 files empty)
- **No component documentation** - Developers can't discover available UI patterns
- **Missing API references** - Data attributes, events, callbacks undocumented
- **Empty features section** - Core capabilities not explained
- **No troubleshooting guide** - Developers stuck when issues arise
- **Zero working examples** - Beyond the single tutorial

---

## Implementation Phases

## Phase 1: Core Reference Documentation (Week 1)
**Foundation API documentation that unblocks developers immediately.**

### Data Attributes Reference
**Complete catalog of every `data-next-*` attribute that controls SDK behavior.**

Content structure:
- Attribute categories (display, action, configuration, state)
- Each attribute with: purpose, values, examples, edge cases
- Common patterns and combinations
- Performance implications

### Events Documentation
**Every event the SDK emits with complete payload structures.**

Content structure:
- Event lifecycle diagram
- Event catalog with triggers and payloads
- Custom event creation
- Event delegation patterns
- Debugging event flows

### Callbacks Documentation
**Lifecycle hooks for extending SDK behavior.**

Content structure:
- Callback registration methods
- Available callback types
- Data structures passed to callbacks
- Async callback handling
- Common integration patterns

### CSS Classes Reference
**Style hooks for theming and customization.**

Content structure:
- Generated class patterns
- State-based classes
- Animation hooks
- Theme variables
- Override strategies

---

## Phase 2: Component Library (Week 1-2)
**How to build complete e-commerce experiences with data attributes.**

### Buttons & Actions
**Every interactive element from add-to-cart to checkout.**

The problem: Most SDKs make you use their button components, breaking your design system.

Core principles:
- **Any element can be a button** via `data-next-action`
- **State automatically managed** through data attributes
- **Accessible by default** with proper ARIA handling

### Display Elements
**Dynamic content that reacts to cart and user state.**

The problem: Traditional approaches require constant API calls and manual DOM updates.

Core principles:
- **Reactive binding** via `data-next-display`
- **Automatic formatting** for prices and quantities
- **Template interpolation** for complex displays

### Form Components
**Checkout forms that validate and submit correctly.**

The problem: Form libraries fight with e-commerce requirements around validation and submission.

Core principles:
- **Native form enhancement** not replacement
- **Progressive validation** that doesn't block users
- **Smart field detection** for address and payment fields

### Quantity Controls
**Stock management and limit enforcement.**

The problem: Quantity controls usually require custom JavaScript for limits and validation.

Core principles:
- **Declarative limits** via attributes
- **Automatic stock checking** before cart updates
- **Accessible number inputs** with keyboard support

### Conditionals
**Show/hide logic based on cart and user state.**

The problem: Conditional rendering typically requires framework overhead.

Core principles:
- **CSS-based toggling** for performance
- **Complex conditions** via attribute expressions
- **No layout shift** through proper placeholder handling
